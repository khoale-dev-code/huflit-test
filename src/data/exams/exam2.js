Man: And? What did they say?
Woman: Nothing much. At the end I asked them, 'What happens now?', and the woman said, 'We'll call you back with news in three or four days.'
Man: Really?
Woman: Yeah, I think I've got the job. There weren't a lot of other people there. I was the only interview that day, you know?
Man: Well, good luck with it.

STORY B - Museum Visit
Man: Anyway, you were saying ...
Woman: Oh, yeah, um ... let's see. Yes, so I was in the museum and there were, I don't know, a hundred people waiting to get into the room. Finally, I got in, and I tried to see the Mona Lisa but I couldn't look at it.
Man: Why not?
Woman: Because the room was filled with people taking photographs of it!
Man: Oh, right.
Woman: Yes! And selfies.
Man: Wait a minute. You can take photos while you're in there?
Woman: Yes, but you can't use flash. I don't know ... Why do we take photos of everything we see when we travel?
Man: I know. And we never look at the photos after.
Woman: Exactly! I'm tired of always taking photos. I don't feel I'm enjoying things.

STORY C - Old Photograph
Man: Who took this?
Woman: I can't remember. Hmmm ...
Man: What am I doing?
Woman: You're sitting on the sofa, watching TV and eating chocolates. Nothing changes!
Man: Ha! Very funny. You look very young, though.
Woman: I know. Look at my hair – it was so long!
Man: Mine too, look at me! Hey … I think I know who took this photo.
Woman: Umm … who? Was it Dad?
Man: No, it wasn't Dad or Mum. Do you remember Barry?
Woman: No.
Man: Yes, YES! You do remember. Barry, your boyfriend at high school. You were seventeen and he was sixteen and he was so very polite: 'Hello, I'm Barry. It's very nice to meet you ...'
Woman: Stop it! He was nice.
Man: Yeah, well, he took the photo.

STORY D - Group Project
Woman: Let's see. OK. I'm glad we could talk about this. It's not easy to say.
Man: What?
Woman: Well, you're not in our group – for the class project.
Man: What do you mean? You know I'm always in a group with you.
Woman: I know. It's just that this time … this time we made the group differently and because you were late ...
Man: I see. You don't want me in the group?
Woman: No, no. It isn't that. It's that we've already made the group, see? There's four of us already.
Man: So? We can't be a group of five?
Woman: Well, the teacher said four people per group.
Man: Oh.
Woman: It's not about you or your work or anything like that. It's ... errrr ... well, we already have the group.

Student 1: So, as far as I know, the main similarity between Mars and Earth is that they can both support human life.
Student 2: Yeah, but do we know that's actually true? I mean, Mars is much colder than Earth, isn't it? It says here it's about minus 55 degrees most of the time, whereas on Earth only places like Antarctica get that cold.
Student 1: True. Well then, I suppose you could say both planets are a similar distance from the Sun?
Student 2: No way! Mars is much further away! It says here it's about 228 million kilometres, while Earth is about 150 million.
Student 1: Yes, but in space that's not that far. Jupiter is, like, almost 780 million kilometres. That's why we use astronomical units when we talk about distances in space. Earth is 1 astronomical unit from the Sun and Mars is 1.3. The difference doesn't sound so big when you look at it that way.
Student 2: I see what you mean. Jupiter is 5.2 astronomical units so I guess you're right. What other similarities are there between the two planets?
Student 1: Let's see … not the colour, obviously!
Student 2: Yeah! Earth is called the blue planet and Mars is called the red planet for pretty obvious reasons!
Student 1: Their sizes are pretty different. Mars is about half the size of Earth.
Student 2: What about this? It looks like the days on both planets are almost the same length. Earth's day is 24 hours but Mars's is about half an hour longer.
Student 1: You're right. OK, any other things they both share?
Student 2: I suppose you could say they have water in common.
Student 1: Could you? How?
Student 2: Well, Earth is 70 per cent water and Mars probably had huge oceans in the past. It's just that most of the water there now is probably frozen.
Student 1: Ah, I see. I don't think we can say the air is the same, though. Most of Earth's air is nitrogen and oxygen, but Mars …?
Student 2: Mars doesn't really have air, not compared with Earth. It's got about one per cent as much air as Earth.
Student 1: Right, and it's mostly carbon dioxide.
Student 2: Gravity is another difference. I didn't know this, but Mars has higher gravity than the Moon. But it's much less than on Earth, of course.
Student 1: Oh, yes. It says Mars has about 38 per cent of Earth's gravity.

      script: `Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to the first lecture of our new course in Positive Psychology. While some people may associate psychology with looking at what's wrong with us, and at what problems we have, there is much more to psychology than that. Positive psychology, for example, looks at how to help people become happier.
This lecture begins with a question: what makes a happy life?
Now, I'm going to give you one possible answer. A happy life is a life in which you are completely absorbed in what you do. Now, how does this compare with what you and your partner said? 
This answer comes from the work of Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi and the theory of flow. Csikszentmihalyi is a psychologist who has spent much of his professional life on the study of what makes people happy and how we can find happiness.
Csikszentmihalyi suggests the theory that happiness is not caused by external events or things that happen to us. Our perception of these things and how we see these events either makes us happy or sad. In other words, if we want happiness, we have to actively look for it. However, this does not mean that we should always look for happiness! Csikszentmihalyi believed that our happiest moments happen when we are in a state of flow.
The theory of flow can be summarised like this: when we are totally involved in, or focused on, what we are doing, we are in a state of flow.
Csikszentmihalyi got the inspiration for this theory when he noticed how artists worked in a studio. They completely lost track of time, they didn't notice they were hungry or tired, and they could work for hours, even days, without stopping. Anyone I have spoken to who has experienced this state of concentration has said it's difficult to explain. The best way to explain it is that it is like being in a river and the flow of the water carries you away.
For the rest of this lecture, I will explore this theory of flow in more detail. First we will look at Csikszentmihalyi's life, and how it influenced his ideas. Then we will look at the conditions that go with a state of flow. What creates flow, exactly? Finally, we will look at activities that can help us achieve flow in our everyday lives. Will this course make you happy for life? Well, maybe. Maybe. 
Right, let's get started. If you look at the next slide …`,

     text: `SARAH T (2:15): Hi James! How's the project coming along?

JAMES (2:18): Hi Sarah! It's progressing well, but I hit a major obstacle yesterday. The client suddenly requested significant changes to the design.

SARAH T (2:19): Oh no! What kind of changes?

JAMES (2:22): They want to completely revamp the color scheme and add several new features that weren't in the original plan. I estimate these changes will require at least two more weeks of work.

SARAH T (2:23): That's frustrating. Have you informed the project manager yet?

JAMES (2:25): Not yet. I wanted to calculate the exact time and cost implications first. I'm planning to meet with Marcus tomorrow morning to discuss everything.

SARAH T (2:26): Smart thinking. Marcus will need to know the financial impact before deciding whether to proceed.

JAMES (2:30): Exactly. I'm also preparing documentation of the requested changes so we have everything in writing. I don't want any miscommunication later.

SARAH T (2:32): That's a good precaution. Are you going to recommend that the client stick with the original plan, or are you open to negotiating?

JAMES (2:35): I think some of their requests are actually good improvements, especially the design changes. However, the new features seem unnecessary and would blow up our budget. I'll suggest we implement the design changes but defer the feature additions until a future phase.

SARAH T (2:37): That sounds like a reasonable compromise. I hope Marcus agrees with your approach.

JAMES (2:40): Thanks for the support, Sarah. I'll let you know how the meeting goes tomorrow.

SARAH T (2:41): Looking forward to it. Good luck!`,
